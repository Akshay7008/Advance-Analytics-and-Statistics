shapiro.test(Mumbai)
shapiro.test(Delhi)
#p.value=0.000773 which is less than 0.05 
#p.value=0.0002928 which is less than 0.05 so data is not normally distributed 
# then also we are doing t.test
t.test(Mumbai,Delhi,mu=0)
#here the p.value = 0.0013 so null is rejected and alternate is accept
# mean of Mumbai is 3.3871 and mean of Delhi is 4.677
# diff=0.8
# conclusion there is a significant difference
